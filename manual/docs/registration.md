To play Syscrack, you must first create a **Syscrack ID**.
Your Syscrack ID is your unified login for all Syscrack services.

In order to create a Syscrack ID, please navigate to the **register** screen
located within the topmost naviagation bar menu.

You should now be met with the registration screen.

## Username

Your username should be a unique name specific to you. If your chosen username
is taken, you will have to choose a new username. In the case where imagination
fails you and you find yourself being unable to create a username, we recommend
using a [gamer tag generator](https://gamertag.net) such as this one.

Your username must be a valid sequence of at least 3 valid ASCII UTF-8 characters,
`-`, `_` and `.`, fitting the following regular expression:
`/[a-Z][0-9][\-][\_][\.]/`

### Examples of valid usernames

Below are some examples of valid usernames. Do note that these are only just
examples, and may be taken already.

- `jcd1337`
- `kn1ghts0f3a5t3rnc5lculus`
- `fs0ciety`
- `xXx__agentsmith420__xXx`

## E-mail

Your e-mail should be your internet mailing address. Some people choose to use
[a separate e-mail address](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/email-aliasing/) to
help minimise their digital footprint, shard their digital identity or simply
just to remove inbox clutter.

Your e-mail, and IP address are the only pieces of uniquely
identifiable information we hold. Your e-mail is used for delivering service
updates, granting access to our news letter, and in combination with your IP
address [helps us reduce
spam](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/spam-emails/).

> **Please note**: The data we hold is safe-guarded [under GDPR
> standards](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection), and can be requested for
> review and deletion by the user at any time.
> For more information on how we use use your data, please read [our privacy
> policy](/privacy-policy)

## Password

We strongly recommend [using a password manager](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-password-managers/)
to safeguard your Syscrack ID. Your password manager can also create secure
passwords on your behalf, remember them for you, and autofill them into
web-sites and forms across the net.

However, creating a secure password can be as simple as using some [commonly
memorable words](https://xkcd.com/936/) in a sentence.

Should you forget your password, you can navigate to the [password reset form on
the web-site](/forgot-password) or [in-game](/user-settings)

## Completing registration

Once you have completed registration, please click the [**login**](#) button near the
bottom-left hand side of the page. It will then take you to a login screen,
where you will have to enter your details once more.
